# LaMP-Cap: Personalized Scientific Figure Captioning Dataset

#### This is a dataset extension of the EMNLP 2021 Findings' paper, [SciCap: Generating Captions for Scientific Figures](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.277/).

LaMP-Cap is an extension of the SciCap dataset, designed specifically for **personalized and context-aware scientific figure caption generation**. Unlike traditional caption datasets, LaMP-Cap provides not only target figures and their metadata, but also **profile figures** from the same scientific paper, enabling research into leveraging multimodal context for improved captioning.

LaMP-Cap is intended for **non-commercial research only** and is released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. By using LaMP-Cap, you agree to the terms in the license.

## Download the Dataset

#### You can download the original SciCap dataset here: [Download Link](https://github.com/tingyaohsu/SciCap/blob/main/README.md)

Our LaMP-Cap dataset includes metadata files built on the original SciCap Challenge dataset that used arXiv paper as identifier to group the figures. We performed random sampling to pick one figure from each paper as target figure, with the remaining figures grouped as profile figures.

### JSON Fields Description

* **arXiv_id:** Unique identifier for the paper (from arXiv)
* **categories:** arXiv primary category of the source paper (e.g., "physics.acc-ph")
* **target:** Metadata for the target figure to be captioned:
    * **image_id:** Figure image ID (matches SciCap)
    * **caption_id:** Caption ID (matches SciCap)
    * **caption_length:** Number of tokens in the caption
    * **figure_type:** Type of figure (e.g., "Graph Plot")
* **profile:** List of profile figures providing context for personalized captioning
    * Each entry contains the same fields as **target**

## Baseline Performance

The caption quality was measured by BLEU-4, using the test set of the corresponding data collection as a reference. We measure the data by using BLEU-4 and ROUGE for the similarity test from the generated caption against the original caption. We also measure the performance with variations such as 1 profile and all profiles.

[Performance metrics and comparison table/figure to be added]
